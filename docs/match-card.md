# Shared match-card presentation

Prompt [018](../dev-plan/018-match-card.md) supplies reusable presentation for
the later feed and detail pages. Components receive visitor-facing props; they
do not fetch providers, start polling, access Redux or persist data. Examples
exist only in tests and isolated acceptance apps.

## Components and composition

Import directly from the owning module under `@/components/match`:

| Module | Public contract |
| --- | --- |
| `match-card` | `MatchCard`, `MatchCardProps`: validated `fixture`, required canonical `analysisSlug`, optional `selectedFamily` (default `match-result`), locale, heading level 2–4 (default 2), and `eagerLogos` (default false). |
| `team-row` | `TeamRow`, `TeamRowProps`: public team, Home/Away side, nullable score, locale and optional eager logo loading. Names remain visible when a logo fails. |
| `probability-label` | `ProbabilityLabel`, `ProbabilityLabelProps`: a complete `AcceptedMarket`, optional selection within that market, and locale. Displays an estimated probability using domain group rounding. |
| `outcome-badge` | `OutcomeBadge`, `OutcomeBadgeProps`: one canonical settlement outcome status and locale. Explicit text plus the shared decorative icon; no live-region announcements for static cards. |
| `match-card-list` | `MatchCardList`: native list with caller-supplied `li` children, one column below the shared `lg` breakpoint (64rem), exactly two above it. Source order remains visual and keyboard order. |

Use the existing root style provider. The card reuses `Surface`, layout, text,
control and feedback primitives and has square corners. Long names and words
wrap inside bounded grid tracks. The analysis link uses `matchHref`, canonical
fixture identity and the supplied slug, with prefetch disabled. The eventual
detail route owns identity lookup and slug canonicalization.

The article's accessible heading names both teams and can match the page's
heading hierarchy. Reading order is competition/kickoff/status, Home, Away,
selected market/prediction, estimated probability, outcome, source/publication
and supplied coverage notices, then View analysis. Each card has one keyboard
destination, with a contextual accessible link name and shared visible focus.
Scores have Home/Away labels; missing scores are announced as unavailable.

## Versioned public data

`parseFixtureSnapshot` validates the shared [state handoff](client-state.md).
018 adds optional fields without changing older valid snapshots:

| Location | Field and meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Team | `logoUrl?: string | null`, a server-approved remote HTTPS catalog URL. |
| Fixture | `partialCoverage?: boolean`, a supplied fixture coverage notice. |
| Forecast | `updateDelayed?: boolean`, an actual delayed-update flag; `provisional?: boolean`, defaulting to true in presentation. |
| Each forecast market | `limitedNews?: boolean` and optional `outcome`. |
| Outcome | `cycleId`, `revisionId`, `selection`, canonical `status`, and nullable public `explanation`. Void requires a nonempty explanation. |

These fields are part of the entire versioned fixture snapshot. A newer version
replaces them together with score/status/forecast; equal or older versions
cannot patch a logo, notice or outcome into the accepted record.

An outcome must match the fixture cycle, forecast revision and that market's
deterministic selection. Correct/Incorrect additionally requires a played final
fixture status. The public server projection must choose the appropriate
published or locked revision and attach only that revision's settled outcomes.
It must never splice a historical locked result into a different forecast.
Explanations must be visitor-safe copy, not internal logs or provider payloads.

`selectedCardPrediction` reads only the selected family. No forecast or missing
family produces Unavailable and no probability, source or invented publication
time. A valid supplied prediction without a matching outcome remains Pending.
The UI does not adjudicate scores. A final fixture can therefore display its
known final score alongside Pending or Unavailable prediction correctness.
The score remains an overall display value, not a verified regulation score;
the settlement domain/server owns regulation-time decisions.

## Probabilities, source and notices

`probabilityEntry` calls `presentMarketProbabilities` on the complete accepted
market. It preserves deterministic selections and largest-remainder rounding
for complementary groups (for example 34/33/33), while double-chance values
remain independently rounded. Boundary labels are Less than 1% and More than
99%, never misleading 0% or 100%. A foreign selection or invalid group fails
validation. Switching families switches the pick, probability, source and
outcome together; correctness never colors unrelated markets or the whole card.

Correct and Incorrect use their existing green/red badge tones. Pending, Void
and Unavailable use gray, each with explicit text and a distinct non-color icon.
Fixture status and score labels remain separate from prediction outcome.

Source comes from the selected market (AI prediction or API-Football fallback).
Publication uses the actual forecast `publishedAt`, an ISO UTC `time` attribute
and a full Gregorian EAT date/time label. Kickoff uses the same shared calendar
validation and explicit Kampala time zone. Browser locale/time zone and the
current clock cannot change the supplied instant. Formatting caches contain
only immutable `Intl` formatters, never visitor data.

Forecasts display Provisional unless explicitly qualified otherwise by trusted
server data. Presentation makes no calibration claim. Update delayed is a
forecast-wide supplied fact, Limited news coverage is selected-market-specific,
and Partial coverage is fixture-wide. Missing notices do not imply full coverage.

## Remote logos and fallbacks

`isSafeRemoteImageUrl` is shared with catalog import, provider normalization and
trial evaluation. It requires a bounded HTTPS URL without credentials, query,
fragment, whitespace, controls or backslashes. This structural check does not
grant media rights: the server catalog/provider approval still decides which
exact URLs may be projected to visitors.

Logos use native `styled.img` with the exact supplied URL, empty alt text,
32px width/height and `object-fit: contain`. The 32px square is reserved before
loading. Default loading is lazy; callers may explicitly opt into eager loading
for known above-the-fold cards. Requests use `no-referrer`. There is no Next
optimizer, server proxy, binary download, image database column or asset copy.

Initials are derived from Unicode team names and remain beneath the image until
it loads. Cached images that finish before hydration are recognized through the
ref. Missing or failed URLs retain initials; a failed image is removed without
repeated retries. Changing the team/URL resets that image state and permits the
replacement to load. Without JavaScript, the stable server initials remain
visible. Logo and initials containers are decorative and hidden from assistive
technology; full team names provide identity throughout.

## Verification

```text
npm run test:card
npm run test:card:rendering
npm run test:card:rendering -- --serve
npm run check
```

The nine domain/state contract tests cover family independence, supplied
outcomes, binding/validation, all sources/notices, boundary/group rounding,
Unicode initials, structural URL checks, actual EAT times and atomic version
replacement. The rendering script builds a separate production Next app under
`.tmp/match-card-*` using the real root layout and shared components. Twelve
labeled synthetic examples include every outcome, both sources, missing/broken
logos, delayed/limited/partial coverage, unknown fields and long names. An
isolated analysis destination exists solely for keyboard acceptance.

Playwright CLI acceptance checks initial server DOM before releasing JavaScript,
cached image hydration, market switching, every link's tab order/focus, Enter
activation, direct image requests, 404/429 and replacement URLs, all five
viewport widths (320, 360, 390, 430 and 1280px), 200% text at 320px, and a
JavaScript-disabled context. Synthetic HTTPS image requests are intercepted
with local test responses; this verifies browser transport/fallback behavior,
not real-provider CDN reliability or media rights. Browser artifacts remain
under ignored `output/playwright/`. Actual results are recorded in
[development progress](development-progress.md).
